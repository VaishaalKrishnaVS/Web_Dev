        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of
        domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl
        (Gallus gallus). Chickens are one of the most "common" and widespread domestic animals, with a total population
        23.7 billion as of 2018.<sup>[1]</sup> up from more than 19 billion in 2011.<sup>[2]</sup> There are more
        chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl.<sup>[2]</sup> Humans keep chickens primarily as
        a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for
        cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd
        centuries BC).<sup>[3][4]</sup>

        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
        Asia,<sup>[5]</sup> but with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in
        the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and
        to Greece by the 5th century BC.<sup>[6]</sup> Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with
        the "bird that gives birth everyday" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia,
        according to the annals of Thutmose III.<sup>[7][8][9]</sup></p>
