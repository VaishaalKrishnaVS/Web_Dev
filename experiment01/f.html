      A book is a medium for recording <del>data</del> <ins>information</ins> in
      the form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages (made of
      papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a
      cover.[1] The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex
      (plural, codices). In the history of
      <del>hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions</del>
      or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet
      in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page
